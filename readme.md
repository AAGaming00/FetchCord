# FetchCord

Fetchcord grabs information about your Distro and displays it as Discord Rich Presence

## Examples
adding new examples(github caches things wierdly)
## What works

- [x] Distro detection

- [x] Package detection

- [x] Kernel Detection

- [x] Uptime

- [x] Distro version
- [x] Detect wm/de

## To-Do(What doesn't work)

- [ ] Add more distros

- [ ] Detect wm/de version


## Running on linux

To run the scrip simply run `python3  run-rpc.py`, python 3.8 should have the `distro` module but if you get an error install it via pip, `pip3 install distro`
## If your distro or de/wm isn't supported, make an issue

## running on macos
run `python3 macos-rpc.py` and it will work!
